I worked with Andrew Yu on some parts of this assignment. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The search algorithms themselves were pretty starightforward. I was able to get them to do the
expansion of all the nodes properly but it wasn't backtracking. I talked to Mike and he gave me
the idea to keep all the paths on the frontier once I did that all the problems were gone. A* I
also had to switch a location of where I was assigning the path value for it to work.

For the four corners search I originally tried to keep a list of all the found corners globally
however I couldn't seem to get that to work properly. So I used the same general idea from the
search algorithm and attached the found corners list to each node that was being sent. 

The corners Heurisitc is just finding the smallest manhattan distance through all 4 corners. I
return the total cost of the shortest path. 

Food heurisitic. I just could not come up with a Heurisitc that was admissable. I tried using the
same one I used for corners except for the corners it was the closest food. This resulted in a 
pacman that would eat all the food however it wasn't admissable. After that I tried using the
total cost of the path that would eat the food with the smallest average distance to all the other
foods. Then I tried using the path that would go to the food with the lowest manhattan distance
to all the other foods and the current point to that food. 

For the suboptimal search I just used the framework that was already in place. It now just chose
the closest food by manhattan distance. The goal state is just checking to make sure the node 
being tested is equal to the closest food. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HOURS SPENT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Roughly 20 hours. A not insignificant part of that was spent on just learning the pacman framework
I also spent a lot of time of the Food Heurisitic coming up with different cases and writing 
implemenations.
