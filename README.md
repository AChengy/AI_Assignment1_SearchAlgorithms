# AI_Assignment1_SearchAlgorithms

This was the first assignment for my Artificial Intelligence class. It uses the Pacman Framework that was created at UC-Berkeley.
It was my first real experience with Python. So it was a good challenge. 

I was able to get everything but the final eat all the food Heuristic down, I was able to pass everything but the admissability
test in a couple of instances. If you know of a heuristic that works PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

The files I edited were Search.py and searchagents.py everything else is part of the framework.
